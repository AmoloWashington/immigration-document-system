These visas are divided into five preference categories, and certain spouses and children may accompany or follow-to-join employment-based immigrants.\n\n## First Steps Toward an Immigrant Visa\nTo be considered for an immigrant visa under some employment-based categories, the applicant's prospective employer or agent must first obtain a labor certification approval from the Department of Labor. Once received, the employer files an **Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, Form I-140** with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for the appropriate employment-based preference category. \n\n**Note:** Persons with extraordinary abilities in the Employment First preference category can file their own petitions.\n\n## Employment Preference Categories\n1. **Employment First Preference (E1):** Priority Workers and Persons of Extraordinary Ability\n   - **Sub-groups:** \n     - Persons with extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics.\n     - Outstanding professors and researchers with at least three years of experience.\n     - Multinational managers or executives.\n\n2. **Employment Second Preference (E2):** Professionals Holding Advanced Degrees and Persons of Exceptional Ability\n   - Requires labor certification and a job offer, but may apply for a National Interest Waiver.\n\n3. **Employment Third Preference (E3):** Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Unskilled Workers.\n\n4. **Employment Fourth Preference (E4):** Certain Special Immigrants.\n\n5. **Employment Fifth Preference (E5):** Immigrant Investors.\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Fees and Visa Application:** Applicants must be aware of the associated fees and the visa application process.\n- **Family Members:** Information on whether family members can also receive immigrant visas.\n- **Numerical Limitations:** There are limits on the number of visas available in each category.\n- **Visa Interview:** Applicants may need to attend a visa interview.\n- **Medical Examinations and Vaccinations:** Requirements for medical exams and vaccinations.\n- **Processing Time:** The time it takes to process the visa application can vary.\n- **Visa Ineligibility:** Information on grounds for visa ineligibility, including misrepresentation or fraud.\n\n## Important Information\n- After receiving an immigrant visa, applicants should know how to enter the U.S. and apply for a Social Security Number.\n- Guidance on what to expect when becoming a permanent resident.\n\nFor more detailed information, applicants should refer to the USCIS Permanent Workers webpage and the specific instructions for Form I-140."
