It is crucial for applicants and their family members to gather these documents to support their visa applications.\n\n## Key Steps\n1. **Complete DS-260**: Before collecting civil documents, ensure that you have completed the DS-260 form for yourself and each family member immigrating with you.\n2. **Document Issuance**: All civil documents must be issued by the official authority in your country. Refer to the [Document Finder](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/the-immigrant-visa-process/step-5-collect-financial-evidence-and-other-supporting-documents/step-7-collect-civil-documents.html) for specific requirements.\n3. **Translations**: Any documents not in English or the official language of your country must be accompanied by certified translations. The translation must include a signed statement from the translator affirming accuracy and competence.\n\n## Important Notices\n- **Missing Documents**: If a required document is unavailable according to country-specific guidelines, you do not need to scan it into your CEAC. However, if you cannot obtain a required document for other reasons, you must submit a detailed written explanation to the NVC when scanning other documents. The consular officer will determine if the missing document is necessary during your visa interview.\n- **Consequences of Missing Documents**: Failure to obtain all required documents may delay your visa application process.\n\n## Required Civil Documents\n- **Birth Certificates**: Original or certified copies for each family member.\n- **Marriage Certificates**: Original or certified copies of all marriage certificates.\n- **Adoption Documents**: If applicable, provide a certified copy of the adoption decree and custody documents.\n- **Court and Prison Records**: Certified copies of records for any criminal convictions.\n- **Military Records**: Photocopy of military records if applicable.\n- **Police Certificates**: Required for individuals aged 16 or older from all countries lived in for more than 6 months.\n- **Photocopy of Valid Passport Biographic Data Page**: Required for each family member.\n\n## Additional Documentation for Petitioners\n- **Petitioner Birth Certificate**: Original or certified copy for the petitioner.\n- **Marriage Termination Documentation**: Evidence of termination of all prior marriages for petitioners who have been previously married.\n\n## Conclusion\nCollecting the appropriate civil documents is a critical step in the immigrant visa process. Ensure that all documents are accurate, complete, and submitted in a timely manner to avoid delays in your application."
