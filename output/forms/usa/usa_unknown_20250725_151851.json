It is particularly relevant for nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those applying for student visas (F-1).\n\n## What is Reciprocity?\nReciprocity refers to the principle that when a foreign government imposes fees on U.S. citizens for certain types of visas, the United States will impose a similar fee on citizens of that country for comparable visa types. Nonimmigrant visa applicants from certain countries may be required to pay a visa issuance fee after their application is approved.\n\n## How to Find Out if You Have to Pay a Reciprocity Fee\n1. **Select Your Country**: Choose your country of nationality from the list provided on the left side menu.\n2. **Select Visa Classifications**: Click on the Visa Classifications tab.\n3. **Choose Visa Type**: Select the type of visa you have applied for (e.g., B-1/B-2 for business or pleasure, F-1 for student visa).\n4. **View Reciprocity Information**: The reciprocity information for your country will be displayed, including:\n   - **Visa Classification**: The type of nonimmigrant visa you are applying for.\n   - **Fee**: The reciprocity fee you must pay, in addition to the nonimmigrant visa application fee (MRV fee).\n   - **Number of Entries**: Indicates how many times you may enter the U.S. with that visa (e.g., “M” for multiple entries).\n   - **Validity Period**: Duration for which the visa is valid from the date of issuance.\n\n## Difference Between Reciprocity Fee and Nonimmigrant Visa Application Fee\n- **Nonimmigrant Visa Application Fee (MRV Fee)**: A nonrefundable fee paid by most applicants for U.S. visas, covering the costs associated with processing the application.\n- **Reciprocity Fee**: Charged only to approved nonimmigrant visa applicants from certain countries, based on the principle of reciprocity.\n\n## Supporting Documents\nApplicants may need to provide various civil documents as required by their country of nationality, along with their passport.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis document serves as a crucial resource for understanding the requirements and fees associated with applying for a U.S. visa, particularly for nonimmigrant applicants from different countries."
