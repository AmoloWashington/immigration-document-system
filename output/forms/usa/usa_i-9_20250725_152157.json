This form must be completed for all employees hired after November 6, 1986, and for all employees in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) hired after November 27, 2011.\n\n## Purpose\n- **Verification of Employment Authorization**: Ensures that employers verify the identity and employment authorization of employees, both U.S. citizens and aliens.\n- **Documentation and Protection Against Discrimination**: Employers must allow employees to choose acceptable documentation and cannot discriminate based on citizenship or immigration status.\n\n## Sections of Form I-9\n1. **Section 1**: Employee Information and Attestation\n2. **Section 2**: Employer Review and Verification\n3. **Acceptable Documents**: Lists that include documents acceptable for verification purposes.\n4. **Supplement A**: Preparer and/or Translator Certification\n5. **Supplement B**: Reverification and Rehire (formerly Section 3)\n\n## Instructions for Employees\n- Complete Section 1 no later than the first day of employment. Employees can also fill out the section before their first day of work, but only after accepting an employment offer.\n- Include the current legal name, address, date of birth, and optionally, a Social Security number.\n\n## Instructions for Employers\n- Employers must complete Section 2 within three business days after the employee's start date, or by the first day if employment is less than three days.\n- Employers must retain completed forms and make them available for inspection if requested.\n- Forms should not be mailed to USCIS or stored unnecessarily. Employers, except those located in Puerto Rico, must use the English version of the form.\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Compliance**: Employers are liable for violations during the verification process.\n- **Discrimination**: It is illegal to request specific documentation or to discriminate based on citizenship or immigration status.\n- For further assistance, refer to the Handbook for Employers: Guidance for Completing Form I-9 (M-274).\n\n## Conclusion\nForm I-9 is a critical tool for employers to verify employment eligibility while also protecting employee rights during the hiring process. Employers and employees must follow the outlined procedures strictly to ensure compliance with federal regulations."
