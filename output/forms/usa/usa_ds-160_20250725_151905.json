This document outlines the requirements and steps necessary to apply for a student visa.\n\n## Visa Categories\n- **F Visa**: For students attending universities, colleges, high schools, private elementary schools, seminaries, conservatories, and other academic institutions.\n- **M Visa**: For students attending vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions, excluding language training programs.\n\n## Important Notes\n- Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas for study purposes.\n- A visitor (B) visa allows for short recreational courses but does not permit enrollment in degree or certificate programs.\n\n## Steps to Apply for a Student Visa\n1. **Acceptance at a SEVP-Approved School**: \n   - Apply to a school certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).\n   - Upon acceptance, the school will issue a **Form I-20** and register you in the **Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)**.\n   - Pay the **SEVIS I-901 fee**.\n\n2. **Complete the Online Visa Application**:\n   - Fill out the **Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application (Form DS-160)**.\n   - Upload a compliant photo during the application process.\n   - Print the application confirmation page for your interview.\n\n3. **Schedule an Interview**:\n   - Generally required for applicants aged 14-79.\n   - Schedule your interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country.\n   - Be aware of varying wait times for interview appointments.\n\n## Additional Information\n- New students can apply for their student visa up to 365 days before their course starts but cannot enter the U.S. more than 30 days before the start date.\n- If dependents (spouse/children) will accompany the student, they must also obtain individual Form I-20s and apply for visas, but they do not pay the SEVIS fee.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, applicants should consult the specific U.S. Embassy or Consulate website where they will apply."
